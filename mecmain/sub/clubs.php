				<p>To Develop, Nurture, Sustain the spirit of entrepreneurship

				E-Cell, the Entrepreneurship forum of Model Engineering College aims to equip students with managerial skills while encouraging an entrepreneurial spirit. It constitutes a group of students committed to the utopian dream of seeing each MECian live up to his/her true capabilities. The E-Cell was born to inculcate in the students of MEC to think outside the all-too-familiar box of placements-jobs-courses. It aims to support those students who think to work in their own right and helps give them life to their ideas.</p>
				<p>
				The E-Cell organizes a wide variety of activities ranging from talk sessions with accomplished entrepreneurs to interactive workshops intended to spread awareness and dispel queries on entrepreneurship and thus widen their perspective about the corporate world.
